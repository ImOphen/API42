# API42

I have made a 42 API python wrapper, where it allows you to make api calls with ease.

> it's very early and doesn't have all the routes and methods, it's a work in progress ^^, Any feedback or ideas are appreciated

## Installation :  
  ``pip install api42``
  
## Examples

 in this example, we can find people searching for a minishell group in Khouribga ( campus 16 )
